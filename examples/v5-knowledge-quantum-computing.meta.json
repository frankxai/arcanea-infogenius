      "The global quantum computing market is projected to reach USD 1.88 billion in 2026 and is predicted to grow to approximately USD 19.44 billion by 2035, expanding at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 29.73% from 2026 to 2035.",
      "In November 2025, Princeton University reported a significant breakthrough, achieving qubit coherence of over 1 millisecond, which is three times longer than previous laboratory records and nearly 15 times longer than the standard in commercial processors.",
      "IBM expects the first instances of \"quantum advantage,\" where quantum computers deliver better, faster, or cheaper solutions than all known classical methods, to be realized by late 2026, especially if the quantum and high-performance computing communities collaborate.",
      "Due to the threat quantum computers pose to current encryption methods, over 50% of organizations expect to have at least one Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithm in place in their systems in 2026.",
      "Current quantum computers, such as IBM's 120-qubit Quantum Nighthawk processor unveiled in late 2025, still require extreme cooling to temperatures near absolute zero (approximately -459 degrees Fahrenheit or 15 millikelvin) to maintain the delicate quantum states of qubits."
