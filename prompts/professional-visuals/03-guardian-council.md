## Why This Works

**Users remember visual metaphors.** The Guardians aren't just features—they're memorable characters that help users choose the right tool.

Design rationale:

- **Abstract silhouettes**: Professional, not childish fantasy
- **Elemental colors**: Instantly communicate personality
- **Central connection**: Shows they work together

## Customization

For your own agent system:
- Replace Guardian names with your agent names
