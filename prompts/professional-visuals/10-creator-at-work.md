# Visual 10: Creator at Work

## Purpose
Aspirational, community building, emotional connection

## The Prompt

```
Create a 16:9 aspirational image of a creator using InfoGenius.

SCENE: Modern workspace, evening, focused creative session

ELEMENTS:
- Silhouette of person at desk (not detailed face)
- Multiple monitors showing visual generation in progress
- Holographic UI elements floating around workspace
- Beautiful generated visuals appearing on screens
- Warm ambient lighting (golden hour through window)
- Coffee cup, notebook, signs of real work

MOOD:
- Productive flow state
- Quiet mastery
- Professional creator, not hobbyist
- "This could be you"

STYLE: Cinematic, editorial quality, slightly desaturated
NOT: Cheesy stock photo, over-the-top futuristic

TEXT (optional, bottom): "Create with clarity."
```

## Why This Works

**People buy into aspirational identities.** This image says "This tool is for serious creators who value quality."

Design rationale:
- **Silhouette (no face)**: Viewer can project themselves
- **Evening setting**: Suggests dedication, creative flow
- **Real work signs**: Coffee, notebook = authenticity
- **Holographic elements**: Tech-forward but grounded
- **Cinematic style**: Premium feel without being fake

## The Psychology

This image answers unconscious questions:
- "Who uses this?" → Serious professionals
- "Will I fit in?" → Yes, if you value quality
- "Is this for me?" → If you're a creator, yes

## Customization

Adjust for your audience:
- **Developer audience**: Add code on screens, darker theme
- **Designer audience**: Color palettes, design tools visible
- **Writer audience**: Documents, research materials
- **Executive audience**: Cleaner desk, presentation on screen

## Expected Output

A 16:9 image suitable for:
- About page
- Community section
- Email headers
- Social media campaigns
