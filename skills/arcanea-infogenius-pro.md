# Arcanea InfoGenius Pro

## When to Use This Skill

**Activate this skill when:**
- Creating premium Arcanea-branded architecture visuals with Guardian AI enhancement
- Generating professional infographics infused with Arcanea mythology and Oracle precision
- Building visual documentation that combines enterprise standards with creative intelligence
- Need Guardian Agent-guided visuals that transcend standard templates

**Use `/arcanea-visual` command to generate enhanced visuals.**

**Don't use when:**
- Need basic OCI diagrams (use standard `oracle-infogenius`)
- Creating simple technical drawings (use CAD tools)
- Internal drafts that don't require Guardian enhancement

---

## Purpose

Generate transcendent visuals that merge:
1. **Oracle Enterprise Standards** - Professional, brand-compliant precision
2. **Arcanea Guardian Intelligence** - 38 specialized AI agents enhancing creativity
3. **Mythology-Infused Design** - Elemental forces and Guardian wisdom
4. **Research-Grounded Accuracy** - Based on actual cloud/tech architecture
